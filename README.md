Hello! I am Karina Atananasova and this is a project where I will develope my coding skills. 
For it to have more of a purpose i decided to combine it with one of my hobbies - photography. 
This is how the idea to make my Photography Portfolio website was born!

I hope for a good journey with a great outcome :)
